Here is my initial view of how the Anonymiser and the CV to Job spec Matcher integrate with the rest of the application
I think it's important to accommodate these long running processes as well as the fact that job specs and CVs are dropped in randomly and they should be processed as soon as possible making judicious use of the AI tools.
